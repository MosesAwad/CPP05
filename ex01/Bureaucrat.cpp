/*
	The << operator overloader cannot be defined as a Bureaucrat
	class member function. The reason for that is because it 
	needs to take an std::ostream as its first parameter to allow
	the operator to work with the output stream. So, If it were 
	defined as a Bereaucrat member function, it would imply that the 
	Bureaucrat class itself would be the left-hand operand in the 
	expression, which is not how the stream insertion operator is 
	typically used. 

	Now, since std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& o, const Bureaucrat& object),
	which is a function that is NOT A MEMBER OF THE BUREAUCRAT CLASS, takes a 
	CONST REFERENCE to a Bureaucrat object, I have to use the getters of the
	Bureaucrat class to access these members and the getters must have the
	CONST keyword at the end of their definition:
		const std::string&	getName() const;
		const int& 			getGrade() const;
	to allow these functions to work with CONST intances of the class as well, 
	which is what we have here because we said "const Bureaucrat& object" in
	the prototype:
		std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& o, const Bureaucrat& object)
*/
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& o, const Bureaucrat& object)
{
	o << object.getName() <<", bureaucrat grade " << object.getGrade();

	return (o);
